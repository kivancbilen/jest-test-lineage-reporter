# 🎯 Interactive Code Tree Features

The enhanced Jest Test Lineage Reporter now provides a **complete interactive code tree visualization** that shows your actual source code with line-by-line test coverage details.

## 🌟 **Key Interactive Features**

### 📋 **Complete Source Code Display**
- **Full source code** of each tested file displayed line by line
- **Monospace font** with proper code formatting
- **Line numbers** with visual indicators for coverage status
- **Syntax preservation** with HTML escaping for special characters

### 🎨 **Visual Coverage Indicators**
- **Green line numbers**: Lines covered by tests
- **Red line numbers**: Lines not covered by any tests  
- **Coverage counters**: Show exact number of tests covering each line
- **"No coverage" indicators**: Clearly mark untested lines

### 🖱️ **Click-to-Expand Functionality**
- **Click coverage indicators** to expand/collapse test details
- **Smooth animations** for expanding and collapsing sections
- **Persistent state** - expanded sections stay open while browsing

### 📁 **Test Organization by File**
- **Grouped by test file**: Tests organized by their source file (e.g., calculator.test.ts, add-only.test.ts)
- **File icons**: Visual indicators for different test files
- **Test badges**: Clickable badges with hover effects and tooltips

## 🔍 **What You Can See at a Glance**

### **Coverage Patterns**
```
Line 5: [15 tests] ← Click to see all 15 tests grouped by file
Line 6: [No coverage] ← Clearly shows untested lines
Line 7: [9 tests] ← Click to see which 9 tests cover this line
```

### **Test Distribution**
- **Comprehensive tests**: Lines covered by many different test files
- **Focused tests**: Lines covered by specific test files only
- **Coverage gaps**: Lines with no test coverage at all

### **Code Quality Insights**
- **Over-tested areas**: Lines with excessive test coverage (potential redundancy)
- **Under-tested areas**: Critical lines with minimal coverage
- **Test isolation**: Which tests are truly isolated vs comprehensive

## 🎯 **Interactive Workflow**

### **1. Browse the Code Tree**
- Scroll through your source code line by line
- See immediate visual feedback on coverage status
- Identify patterns in test coverage

### **2. Investigate Specific Lines**
- Click on coverage indicators to see detailed test information
- Understand which test files contribute to each line's coverage
- Identify redundant or missing test coverage

### **3. Analyze Test Patterns**
- See how different test files cover different parts of your code
- Understand the relationship between test organization and coverage
- Make informed decisions about test refactoring

## 📊 **Enhanced Statistics**

### **File-Level Metrics**
- **Total Lines**: Complete line count of the source file
- **Lines Covered**: Number of lines with test coverage
- **Unique Tests**: Total number of distinct tests covering the file

### **Line-Level Details**
- **Test Count**: Exact number of tests covering each line
- **Test Sources**: Which test files contribute to coverage
- **Test Names**: Full test descriptions with tooltips

## 🎨 **User Experience Enhancements**

### **Visual Design**
- **Color-coded line numbers**: Instant coverage status recognition
- **Hover effects**: Interactive feedback on clickable elements
- **Clean typography**: Easy-to-read code with proper spacing
- **Responsive layout**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile

### **Navigation**
- **Smooth scrolling**: Easy navigation through large files
- **Persistent state**: Expanded sections remain open
- **Quick scanning**: Visual indicators help identify areas of interest

### **Accessibility**
- **High contrast**: Clear distinction between covered and uncovered lines
- **Tooltips**: Full test names available on hover
- **Keyboard friendly**: All interactions work with keyboard navigation

## 🚀 **Practical Benefits**

### **For Developers**
- **Immediate feedback** on test coverage quality
- **Visual identification** of untested code paths
- **Easy exploration** of test-code relationships

### **For Code Reviews**
- **Visual evidence** of test coverage in pull requests
- **Quick identification** of areas needing more tests
- **Clear documentation** of testing thoroughness

### **For Team Planning**
- **Coverage gap analysis** for sprint planning
- **Test redundancy identification** for refactoring
- **Quality metrics** for project health assessment

## 🎯 **Example Use Cases**

### **Finding Coverage Gaps**
1. Scroll through the code tree
2. Look for red line numbers (uncovered lines)
3. Click nearby covered lines to understand test patterns
4. Identify missing test scenarios

### **Identifying Test Redundancy**
1. Click on lines with high test counts (e.g., "15 tests")
2. Review which test files are covering the same lines
3. Consider consolidating or removing redundant tests

### **Understanding Test Architecture**
1. Explore how different test files cover different functions
2. See which tests are comprehensive vs focused
3. Plan better test organization strategies
